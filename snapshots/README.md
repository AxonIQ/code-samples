# Snapshot

In this demo we will show how to define and configure a Snapshot Trigger for a given Aggregate.

Eventually you will need to speed up the Event Sourcing part of your Aggregate because the number of events exceeds your
defined aggregate loading time. That is when a Snapshot is desirable. Axon Framework helps you on that by simply
configuring a `SnapshotTriggerDefinition` and instructing your `Aggregate` to use that.

To do it, as said before, you have to configure one or more `SnapshotTriggerDefinition` instances. Axon Framework
already provides some implementations, but you are free to implement your own:

1. [NoSnapshotTriggerDefinition](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/blob/master/eventsourcing/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventsourcing/NoSnapshotTriggerDefinition.java):
   Implementation that doesn't trigger snapshots at all.
2. [EventCountSnapshotTriggerDefinition](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/blob/master/eventsourcing/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventsourcing/EventCountSnapshotTriggerDefinition.java):
   Snapshotter trigger mechanism that counts the number of events to decide when to create a snapshot.
3. [AggregateLoadTimeSnapshotTriggerDefinition](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/blob/master/eventsourcing/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventsourcing/AggregateLoadTimeSnapshotTriggerDefinition.java):
   A Snapshotter trigger mechanism which based on the loading time of an Aggregate decides when to trigger the creation
   of a snapshot.

To make it available for the application to use, you have 2 options. When using Spring Boot AutoConfiguration, just
provide it as a `@Bean` like we did in this
example [here](./src/main/java/io/axoniq/dev/samples/SnapshottingApplication.java).

```
@Bean
public SnapshotTriggerDefinition mySnapshotTriggerDefinition(Snapshotter snapshotter) {
    return new EventCountSnapshotTriggerDefinition(snapshotter, 5);
}
```

and instruct your aggregate to use it like
done [here](./src/main/java/io/axoniq/dev/samples/command/MyEntityAggregate.java).

```
@Aggregate(snapshotTriggerDefinition = "mySnapshotTriggerDefinition")
public class MyEntityAggregate {
   // ...
}
```

Or when using Axon Configuration API, you can configure it to your Aggregate like this:

```
AggregateConfigurer<MyEntityAggregate> myEntityAggregateConfigurer =
        AggregateConfigurer.defaultConfiguration(MyEntityAggregate.class)
                           .configureSnapshotTrigger(config -> new EventCountSnapshotTriggerDefinition(
                                   config.snapshotter(), 5
                           ));
Configurer configurer = DefaultConfigurer.defaultConfiguration()
                                         .configureAggregate(myEntityAggregateConfigurer);
```

In both cases, after every 5 events*, a Snapshot will be created. You can check if it was created or not by looking at
your logs for the following line:
`o.a.a.c.event.axon.AxonServerEventStore  : Snapshot created`.

> 5 is fine for testing, but in real life you would likely use a threshold between 100 and 250. Important to note is
> that it will always depend on your Aggregate implementation, so measuring how long it takes to load an Aggregate and
> basing the count on that will end you up with the most optimal solution.

To test the project, we provide a [requests.http](./requests.http). But you can do the same using curl, like this:

```
curl --data POST "http://localhost:8080/entity/entity-id?name=Entity Name"

curl --data PATCH "http://localhost:8080/entity/entity-id?name=New Name"
```
